        <br /> You did {getAdjective(finishedDays.length)}
        <br /> You answered correct on{" "}
        <span className="text-lg">{finishedDays.length} out of 24 days</span>
        {finishedDays.length === 24 ? (
          "!"
        ) : (
          <>
            ,
            <br /> but fear not! You can still go back
